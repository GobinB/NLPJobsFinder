#Before staring the project make sure to run the following commands:

#npm install
#npm start (This will start both the frontend and backend)

#npm run start:frontend 
#npm run start:backend 


You have to be on bash: 

rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf backend/node_modules
rm -rf frontend/node_modules


then npm install from root and npm start.
